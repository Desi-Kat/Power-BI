**Task List:**

- Import libraries and load data
- Clean and preprocess data
- Conduct exploratory data analysis
- Draw conclusions and insights

  Actions:
- Using formulas and measures to create links between tables
- Creating and updating relationships between tables in Model view
- Creating visuals and customising values and visual effects
- Adding Markers and Labels
- Colour coding to emphasise performance

**Conclusions:**

By defining the maximum average discount rate and the minimum profit ratio, I was able to sort the employees into Low, Medium and High performance. By using measures to assign colour, I was able to visually represent this.

**Task List:**

- Get data
- Clean and transform data
- Create a map visual
- Create charts

**Conclusions:**
The dashboard enables the user to interact with the visuals and view sales data across various sales regions and analyse performance by year and quarter which will potentially enable data-informed decisions on where to focus marketing efforts.
