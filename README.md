**1. Power BI Sales Performance Analysis**

**Description:**
This project investigates sales performance figures and sales person performance. It shows total sales, total profit, profit ratio and average discount rate and compares employee performance by using line charts and creating measures.

**Technologies:**
Power BI

**Dataset:**
There were 6 data sets used and data was transformed to ensure relevant columns are used for the aim of the analysis.

**Task List:**

- Import libraries and load data
- Clean and preprocess data
- Conduct exploratory data analysis
- Draw conclusions and insights

  Actions:
- Using formulas and measures to create links between tables
- Creating and updating relationships between tables in Model view
- Creating visuals and customising values and visual effects
- Adding Markers and Labels
- Colour coding to emphasise performance

**Conclusions:**

By defining the maximum average discount rate and the minimum profit ratio, I was able to sort the employees into Low, Medium and High performance. By using measures to assign colour, I was able to visually represent this.

**2. Power BI Total Sales Excluding Tax**

**Description:**

Report on sales and demonstrate annual sales and geographical distribution over 4 consecutive years.

**Dataset:**

Two datasets were used and cleaned in PowerQuery

**Task List:**

- Get data
- Clean and transform data
- Create a map visual
- Create charts
- Enable drill mode and expand hierarchy so that visuals can update
- For regular updates - uploading a new dataset in the storage folder will allow automatic update to the dashboards without performing data transformation again.

**Conclusions:**
The dashboard enables the user to interact with the visuals and view sales data across various sales regions and analyse performance by year and quarter which will potentially enable data-informed decisions on where to focus marketing efforts.

  **2.1 Sales Dashboard**

  Using two more datasets as practice I have identified profit and sales by geographical location, segment and average discount.

**Description**: I created a model by importing and transforming 3 tables in PowerQuery. I created measures for Number of employees and Average Satisfaction and a Business Unit hierarchy which allowed me to visualise the Total Training Cost by Department, Business Unit and Division.

**4. Work-Based Projects**

   **Data Analytics Learner Analysis**

**Description:** I oversee the reporting for Data Analytics training and use the Learner Analysis to track and present progress. In collaboration with my team of Data Analytics trainers, the dashboards below were created to inform actions and drive quality of our programmes.
